# Design
{: .fs-9 }

In this document, we will approach the product from the user's point of view, leaving aside all the technical information. Indeed, here we want to emphasize the *"product design"* and planning methodologies we have used to build the idea, and how these directly influenced the final product.

This application is thought to be used by everyone who like movies or tv series, we started our journey with a simple survey, sharing it with our family, friends, and friends of friends.
It gave us an idea of the opinions people would have (explained in the "Evaluation" document), and helped us to better understand who and how the user would use our product.

### Problem
Nowadays, we are experiencing the rising of the home cinema, there are a bunch of different providers that feed on daily bases a massive collection of titles in their platform, and while this is an incredible opportunity to get in touch with different cultures and titles, on the other side sometimes we get overwhelmed on what, when and where watch Movies and Tv Shows. 
For most people choosing a film to watch it's an operation that requires struggle and time, sometimes we forget titles and other times we think that don't have anything to watch.
Therefore, we want to provide a different way to organize Watchlists, share them with our friends and get inspired by other people while at the same time getting in touch with updates on titles that we love in a single place, distant just a few taps from your pocket.

### Solution

Create a **M**ovies Comm**unity**!
* Collects titles inside customizable watchlists and keep tracking them.
* Shares your Collections with friends on community.
* Inspire and get Inspired by the community.
* Get notified of your preferred titles.
* Interact with a chatbot to reserve a seat in your preferred Theatre.
* Receive suggestions on new titles by an I.A. algorithm based on your preferences.
* Earn badges and increase your reputation in the community through Gamification.
* (EXTRA) Organize watch parties.

### Benefits

* Get updated when preferred shows get a new season or episode.
* A place to ask, seek and share titles.
* Get rewarded for organizing watch lists.
* Give new live to underrated titles.
* Learn where to watch titles.
* Get in touch with Theatres.
